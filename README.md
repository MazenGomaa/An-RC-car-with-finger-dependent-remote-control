# An-RC-car-with-finger-dependent-remote-control
my AMIT Final project with hardware

The software implimintation is done using the arduino core with a simi custom version of embedded Eclipse with the Sloeber plugin

The code for the remote is optimaised to work very well with an ATMEGA8 chip, while the car's would work very well with an ATMEGA328 or AYMEGA16
